# Exploring-Agriculture-Yield-Dynamics-
An Exploratory Data Analysis in R

## Abstract
This study delves into the intricate dynamics of agricultural yield by examining a diverse dataset
including crop yield, rainfall, pesticides, and temperature across various regions. Employing
statistical techniques and visualizations, our study explores temporal trends, regional variations,
and the impact of environmental factors on crop production. Through correlation analyses, we
identify relationships between yield and climate variables. The entire analysis is done in the R
programming language. Additionally, we employ the ‘fitdistrplus’ package in R to find the most
suitable distribution for yield data. The results showcase the significance of understanding the
interplay between meteorological conditions and agricultural output.

## Introduction to dataset
The dataset employed in this analysis contains information on agricultural yield, including key
variables such as geographical region, crop type, year, yield (in hectogram per hectare), average
rainfall (in mm per year), pesticides usage (in tonnes), and average temperature (in degree
celsius). Covering multiple countries, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of how these
factors interact and influence crop production over time. The dataset's temporal scope spans
from 1990, allowing for a thorough analysis of trends and patterns. With a focus on essential
crops like Potatoes, Rice, Maize and Sorghum, the dataset facilitates a detailed understanding of
the complexities inherent in agricultural systems.
